During my 11th grade year at the Chattanooga STEM School I had the opportunity to work professional projects with local business partners. 

One of the first projects I worked on was a heater for a weather balloon. The the local university had launched a weather balloon with a GoPro. However, once the balloon reached a certain altitude the GoPro became too cold and stopped recording. We designed a heating element and temperature sensor to be placed in a small enclosure with the GoPro and regulate its temperature. It regulates the temperature by alternating the heating element on and off based on the temperature readings.

The foam casing for the device was basically useless as an insulator. If we had had more time we would have probably replaced it with a better insulator.

The Go Pro was heated from the back, as the front could not be covered. The ardunio also recorded the temperature and heating cycle to flash memory so we could analyze it later. We spent a day in the biology closet testing it in the freezer.
