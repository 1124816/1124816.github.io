As one of my 11th grade PBL's I worked on a heater for a weather balloon. It's basically just a heating element and a temperature sensor. It regulates the temperature by alternating the heating element on and off based on the temperature readings.

The foam casing for the device was basically useless as an insulator. If we had had more time we would have probably replaced it with a better insulator.

The Go Pro was heated from the back, as the front could not be covered. We spent a day in the biology closet testing it in the freezer.
